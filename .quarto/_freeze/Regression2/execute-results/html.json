To start, we will consider the case where the dependent variable is binary, requiring the use of logistic regression. We will then show how logistic regression is just a special case of a more general class of models called generalized linear models. With these we can model a variety of different types of dependent variables, including count data and ordinal data. Lastly, we will explore how to evaluate the performance of these models and control for overfitting by splitting our data into training and testing sets and incorporating regularization.\n\n::: {#4ab46f7a .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport os\nimport json\nimport patsy # for creating design matrices\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Logistic regression: modeling probability of binary outcomes\n\nA binary classifier takes a set of measurements, $\\boldsymbol{X}$, as inputs and returns the probability that they were generated by a specific event, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$. To get from $\\boldsymbol{x}$ to $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$, we need a function that describes the *probability* of the class occurring over a range of measurement values.\n\n### A quick probability primer\n\nProbabiltilies describe how likely events are to occur. They range from 0, for events that never happen, to 1, for events that are guaranteed to happen. When quantifying probabilities we do this for a class of events, with the total probability across all events adding up to 1 (which means that at any time one of them has to occur). For instance, in the case of flipping a coin, there is a 0.5 (1/2 or 50%) chance that the coin will come up Heads, and 0.5 that it will be Tails. These are the only possibilities (this is a Platonic coin, so it has no thickness and thus cannot land on its side). A coin flip is a good example of an *unconditional probability*, which is the same regardless of the circumstances. For this, we would write:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\np(H)&=0.5 \\\\\np(T)&=0.5 \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhich says that the probability of the coin coming up heads, $p(H)$, is 0.5, and the probability of coming up tails, $p(T)$, is 0.5.\n\nBut probabilities can also depend on the situation, such as the probability that you will buy lunch at a certain time. It is more likely that you will purchase lunch at 11:30 AM than at 10:00 AM. This is a *conditional probability*. Conditional probabilities are expressed as $P(Lunch|Time)$, which translates as the probability of going for Lunch, ($Lunch$), is conditional, $|$, on the time, $Time$. For a conditional probability we need to know the time to give the probability that we are going to lunch.\n\n### The logistic function\n\nOne equation that is a useful way to express a conditional probability is the *logistic function* (also known as the sigmoid function). It has the form:\n\n$$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $$\n\nLet's code it up and visualize it:\n\n::: {#5a058081 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# create a logistic function\ndef logistic(x):\n    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x)) \n\n# plot the logistic function\nx = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)\nplt.plot(x, logistic(x))\nplt.title('Logistic Function')\nplt.yticks(np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.25))\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=597 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis function has a couple of features that make it useful for modeling probabilities. First, it is bounded between 0 and 1, meaning that it will not go beyond the range of values taken by a measure of probability. Second, it's value can be directly interpreted as a probability. For instance, if $\\sigma(x)=0.5$, then the probability of the event occurring is 0.5. If it returns a value greater than 0.5, we can say that the event is more likely to occur than not. If it returns a value less than 0.5, we can say that the event is less likely to occur than not. When we use the logistic function to predict whether an event will occur, 0.5 will be our cutoff. This is often referred to as the *decision boundary*.\n\nWe can insert our linear model into the logistic function to get the probability of an event occurring. Recall that: $$\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol{y}_i &= \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1\\boldsymbol{x}_{1,i} + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_2\\boldsymbol{x}_{2,i} + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_3\\boldsymbol{x}_{3,i} + ... + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_p\\boldsymbol{x}_{p,i} \\notag \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{y}_i &= \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_j\\boldsymbol{x}_{j,i} \\notag \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{y} &= \\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\notag \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWe can pass this into the logistic function to get the probability the event occurring. This is the logistic regression model.\n\n$$ \\begin{align}\n\\hat{y}_i &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_j\\boldsymbol{x}_{j,i})}} \\notag \\\\\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} &= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\boldsymbol{x}}} \\notag \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a vector of $\\beta$ coefficients and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ is a vector of dependent variables.\n\nGiven that we have modified the input to the logistic function to now be a linear equation, we can try to understand how the decision boundary is affected by the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ vector. To start, we will consider the simple case where we just have an intercept, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0$, and one independent variable, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1$. Since the decision boundary happens at $\\sigma(x)=0.5$, we can solve for $x$ when $\\sigma(x)=0.5$.\n\n$$ \\begin{align}\n        \\notag 0.5&=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \\\\\n        \\notag 0.5&=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-0}} \\\\\n        \\notag 0.5&=\\frac{1}{1+1} \\\\\n        \\notag 0.5&=\\frac{1}{2}\n    \\end{align}\n$$\n\nSince the decision boundary will occur when $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1x=0$, we can use some simple algebra to solve for the corresponding value of $x$. $$ \\begin{align}\n        \\notag 0&=-(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0+\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1x) \\\\\n        \\notag 0&=-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1x \\\\\n        \\notag \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0&=-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1x \\\\\n        \\notag -\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0}{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1}&=x\n    \\end{align}\n$$\n\nThis means that the decision boundary depends on both the intercept and the slope. As you increase the intercept, you move the decision boundary to lower values. Increasing the slope, however, will shift the boundary towards 0. Let's visualize these relationships.\n\n::: {#2b1d0f01 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef logistic_linear(x, beta):\n    return logistic(np.dot(x, beta))\n\nx = np.hstack([np.ones((100,1)), np.linspace(-10, 10, 100).reshape(-1,1)])\nvar_ints = [-5,-2.5,0,2.5,5]\nvar_slopes = [0.125,0.25,0.5,1,2]\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2,1)\nfor ind, var_int in enumerate(var_ints):\n    y = logistic_linear(x, [var_int, 1])\n    axs[0].plot(x[:,1], y, label=f'intercept={var_int}', color=[0,0,ind/len(var_ints)])\n    axs[0].vlines(-var_int, 0, 1, color=[0,0,ind/len(var_ints)], linestyle=':')\naxs[0].legend()\naxs[0].grid()\naxs[0].set_title('Varying Intercept')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('$\\sigma(x)$')\n\nfor ind, var_slope in enumerate(var_slopes):\n    y = logistic_linear(x, [0, var_slope])\n    axs[1].plot(x[:,1], y, label=f'slope={var_slope}', color=[ind/len(var_slopes),0,0])\naxs[1].legend()\naxs[1].grid()\naxs[1].set_title('Varying Slope')\naxs[1].set_xlabel('x')\nfig.tight_layout()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=660 height=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne thing in common for the logistic curves plotted above is that as we increase $x$ the probability also increases. To make the probability decrease as $x$ increases, we set our slope to be negative. If we do this without also changing the sign of our intercept, then the decision boundary will change too (see the equation above). In addition, as we increase the magnitude of the slope, the decision boundary will move closer to 0.\n\n::: {#58fb55c1 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2,1)\nfor ind, var_int in enumerate(var_ints):\n    y = logistic_linear(x, [var_int, -1])\n    axs[0].plot(x[:,1], y, label=f'intercept={var_int}', color=[0,0,ind/len(var_ints)])\n    axs[0].vlines(-var_int, 0, 1, color=[0,0,ind/len(var_ints)], linestyle=':')\naxs[0].legend()\naxs[0].grid()\naxs[0].set_title('Varying Intercept with negative slope')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('$\\sigma(x)$')\n\nfor ind, var_int in enumerate(var_ints):\n    y = logistic_linear(x, [var_int, 2.5])\n    axs[1].plot(x[:,1], y, label=f'intercept={var_int}', color=[ind/len(var_ints),0,0])\n    axs[1].vlines(-var_int/2.5, 0, 1, color=[ind/len(var_ints),0,0], linestyle=':')\naxs[1].legend()\naxs[1].grid()\naxs[1].set_title('Varying Intercept with larger slope')\naxs[1].set_ylabel('$\\sigma(x)$')\n\nfig.tight_layout()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-5-output-1.png){width=660 height=469}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn general, we can say that the direction of increasing probability is determined by the slope, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1$, and the location of the decision boundary is determined by the intercept ($\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0$) scaled by the slope. In general, this holds true for multiple dimensions as well. The decision boundary is a hyperplane that is perpendicular to the weight vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta_{1:p}}$. The offset of the decision boundary from the origin is determined by the intercept and the slope of the weight vector. This is fairly easy to see in two dimensions, when you have two independent variables.\n\n::: {#937edc65 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx_1, x_2 = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-10, 10, 100), np.linspace(-10, 10, 100))\nx_1 = x_1.flatten()\nx_2 = x_2.flatten()\n\nbetas = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [-4, 1, 1]])\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(8,4))\ny = logistic_linear(np.hstack([np.ones((10000,1)), np.vstack([x_1, x_2]).T]), betas[0])\naxs[0].imshow(y.reshape(100,100), origin='lower', extent=(-10, 10, -10, 10), cmap='Blues')\naxs[0].plot([0, 0],[10, -10], color='r', linestyle='--')\naxs[0].set_title('Beta = {}'.format(betas[0]))\naxs[0].set_ylabel('$x_2$')\naxs[0].grid()\n\ny = logistic_linear(np.hstack([np.ones((10000,1)), np.vstack([x_1, x_2]).T]), betas[1])\naxs[1].imshow(y.reshape(100,100), origin='lower', extent=(-10, 10, -10, 10), cmap='Blues')\naxs[1].plot([-10, 10],[10, -10], color='r', linestyle='--')\naxs[1].set_title('Beta = {}'.format(betas[1]))\naxs[1].set_xlabel('$x_1$')\naxs[1].grid()\n\ny = logistic_linear(np.hstack([np.ones((10000,1)), np.vstack([x_1, x_2]).T]), betas[2])\naxs[2].imshow(y.reshape(100,100), origin='lower', extent=(-10, 10, -10, 10), cmap='Blues')\naxs[2].plot([-6, 10],[10, -6], color='r', linestyle='--')\naxs[2].set_title('Beta = {}'.format(betas[2]))\naxs[2].grid()\nfig.tight_layout()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){width=757 height=264}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere the decision boundary is denoted by the red dashed line, the probability is the color scale. White is 0 and dark blue is 1. If we set the intercept to 0 and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1$ to 1, then we have the 2D version of the default logistic function. The decision boundary is a vertical line at $x_1=0$. When both $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_2$ are 1, the decision boundary is a diagonal line. The direction of the decision boundary is determined by the weights. If we then set the intercept, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0$, to a non-zero value (here -4), we shift that decision boundary away from the origin.\n\n### Logistic regression for binary classification\n\nLet's now try to fit a logistic function to some real data. For this example I have compiled a small dataset where the strength of an evoked response potential (ERP) was measured. On some trials, an auditory stimulus was given, driving a strong ERP, while on others no auditory stimulus was presented, resulting in no ERP. The goal is to predict whether an auditory stimulus was given based on the strength of the ERP. We will use logistic regression to do this. First we will load in the data.\n\n::: {#5e4f1700 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# load the data\ndata_dir = './data/'\nlogreg_data = json.load(open(os.path.join(data_dir, 'logregdata.json'), 'r'))\n\n# convert the data to numpy arrays\nX = np.array(logreg_data['X'])\ny = np.array(logreg_data['y'])\n\n# display to make sure it looks right\nprint('X = {}'.format(X))\nprint('y = {}'.format(y))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nX = [ 47.8682191   79.21943476  59.77661572  67.42808345 106.59886022\n  45.76555801 103.45205398  56.59460022  60.77195205 111.57862896\n  32.41245229 118.75920507  41.79053316  81.33619878  54.6388707\n  45.60598449  51.5419817   39.32098506  45.9932129   52.26591628\n  27.40391158  26.07979312  46.61066192  25.94308383  64.4758095\n  -1.39409509 -17.08503545  49.70176208 -11.90910869  34.66836456\n   8.93607429  17.14723219 -29.02676859   3.89797864 -17.66074236\n   3.3038969   26.80126476  31.49036756  10.76049118   9.53549015\n   4.30966256  13.1381603  -25.56534353   2.20072814  41.21241201\n  -7.3085461   26.00222903  32.07631057  -2.19790223 -19.46658645\n   1.24571761 -20.11255289   0.51001914 -53.37683445]\ny = [1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1. 1.\n 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.\n 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe have two numpy arrays values. `X` is the ERP strength measured on each trial, while `y` is a binary variable indicating whether an auditory stimulus was given.

We will use the `fit` method to fit the model to the data. The `summary` method will give us a summary of the model fit.\n\nIt is a good idea to visualize the data before fitting a model to it.

There, the p-value for the ERP term is 0.001. We can also find the decision boundary based on the coefficients that the model has learned. 'Const' is the value of the intercept, and 'ERP' is the slope. The decision boundary is given by $-\\frac{Const}{ERP}=\\frac{-4.38}{0.13}=33.69$.\n\nThe logistic model $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ values can be pulled out of the `results` object.

The statistically significant factors are the same as with the logistic regression model. However, let's plot the residuals to see if there is a pattern in the errors.\n\n::: {#42d18636 .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ny_pred = lin_res.predict(sm.add_constant(df['ERP']))\ny_resid = df['stim'] - y_pred\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.scatter(X, y_resid)\nax.axhline(0, color='r', linestyle='--')\nax.set_xlabel('ERP strength')\nax.set_ylabel('Residual')\nax.set_title('Residuals vs. ERP strength')\nax.grid()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-12-output-1.png){width=606 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEek! This is not good. The residuals are systematically varying with the ERP strength. This arises because the dependent variable can only take on two values, 0 or 1, while the linear model is predicting continuous values ranging from negative to positive infinity. As you keep increasing the ERP strength, you will eventually get values exceeding 1 (or below 0 if you decrease ERP strength), which would not make sense as a value that reflects the probability of an event.\n\n## Generalized linear models\n\nThe logistic regression model is a special case of a more general class of models called *generalized linear models* (GLMs). In the logistic model we took our linear model and passed it through a logistic function to get the probability of an event occurring (an auditory stimulus). This was to ensure that the output was bounded between 0 and 1, just as a probability value should be. GLMs are a generalization of this idea. Instead of just using the logistic function, we can use other functions that capture properties of the dependent variable.\n\nSo far we have covered two of them. For the linear model, this is just the identity function, $f(x)=x$. The identity function is used when the dependent variable is continuous and unbounded. For the logistic model, we used, $f(x)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$.\n\nIn general, a GLM has three components:\n\n1\\. A linear model, $\\boldsymbol{y}=\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.\n\n2\\. A link function, $g(\\mu)$, that transforms the conditional mean, $\\mu$, of the dependent variable (i.e. its mean value given the dependent variables) to a range suitable for the linear model.\n\n3\\. Inverse of the link function, $f(\\boldsymbol{y})$, that maps the linear model to the dependent variable. This is what we have used so far for the logistic equation. It is helpful for predicting the dependent variable given the independent variables.\n\nThere are many other mean functions beyond the identity and logistic functions. Below is a table of some and there properties:\n\n| Distribution | Link function | Inverse of the link function | Properties | Neuroscientific applications |\n|------------|------------------|------------|------------------|------------|\n| Normal | $g(\\mu)=\\mu$ | $f(y) = y$ | Continuous, Unbounded | Relating BOLD signal to task variables |\n| Poisson | $g(\\mu)=\\log(\\mu)$ | $f(y) = e^y$ | Count data, positive | Spike counts |\n| Binomial | $g(\\mu)=\\log(\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu})$ | $f(y) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-y}}$ | Binary data | Go/No-go decisions |\n| Gamma | $g(\\mu)=-\\frac{1}{\\mu}$ | $f(y) = -\\frac{1}{y}$ | Continuous, positive | Reaction times |\n\nIn neuroscience one frequently encounters data that is best described by the Poisson distribution. This distribution is appropriate for count data, which starts at 0 and can go up to positive infinity. To map the output of a linear model onto that distribution (i.e. the inverse link function), one uses the the exponential function. This can be expressed as $\\boldsymbol{y}_i=e^{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\boldsymbol{X}_i}$. The behavior of the exponential function, $e^x$, is such that it is always positive and increases as $x$ increases.\n\nLet's examine how this function behaves.\n\n::: {#a35ada71 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# inverse link function for poisson GLM\ndef exp_linear(x, beta):\n    return np.exp(np.dot(x, beta))\n\n# Parameters for example exponential functions\nx = np.hstack([np.ones((100,1)), np.linspace(-2, 2, 100).reshape(-1,1)])\nvar_ints = [-1,-0.5,0,0.5,1]\nvar_slopes = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5]\n\n# plot the exponential functions\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2,1)\nfor ind, var_int in enumerate(var_ints):\n    y = exp_linear(x, [var_int, 1])\n    axs[0].plot(x[:,1], y, label=f'intercept={var_int}', color=[0,0,ind/len(var_ints)])\naxs[0].axhline(1, color='r', linestyle='--')\naxs[0].legend()\naxs[0].grid()\naxs[0].set_title('Varying Intercept')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('$e^x$')\n\nfor ind, var_slope in enumerate(var_slopes):\n    y = exp_linear(x, [0, var_slope])\n    axs[1].plot(x[:,1], y, label=f'slope={var_slope}', color=[ind/len(var_slopes),0,0])\naxs[1].legend()\naxs[1].grid()\naxs[1].set_title('Varying Slope')\naxs[1].set_xlabel('x')\nfig.tight_layout()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-13-output-1.png){width=660 height=468}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is frequently used with spike count data, where the number of spikes is modeled as a Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution that models the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space. It is defined by a single parameter, $\\lambda$, which is the average number of events in the interval (note, since it is an average that means $\\lambda$ can be a decimal number, it does not have to be an integer like the counts in the Poisson distribution). With a GLM, we can model the expected number of spikes as a function of multiple independent variables. Here $\\lambda=e^{\\boldsymbol{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$.\n\nSimilar to the logistic function, the exponential function will be shifted by the intercept and scaled by the slope. There is no decision boundary in this case, but the slope will determine the rate at which the expected number of spikes increases as the independent variable increases. The intercept will determine the expected number of spikes when the independent variable is 0.\n\n### Example with visual coding\n\nWe can use a Poisson GLM to model the number of spikes a neuron produces in response to visual stimuli. Our dependent variables will be the properties of the visual stimuli, while the independent variable will be the number of spikes.\n\nSince [1959](https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1959.sp006308) it has been known that neurons in the primary visual cortex respond to moving lines in the visual field. It was a [chance observation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOHayh06LJ4) by Hubel and Wiesel, that lead them to identify the space of stimuli that optimally drive neuronal responses in primary visual cortex. They found that when a bar of light moved across a specific area of the visual field, it would elicit single neuron spiking when it occurred at a particular angle. The further it rotated away from that angle, less of a response was elicited.\n\n![HubelWiesel1959](./images/HubelWiesel1959.png)\n\nWhile bars of a light can be easily generated and their properties modified, modern visual physiologists use *drifting gratings*, which can be loosely thought of as a series of white bars moving across a black background. To see what they look like, check out this [link](https://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding/stimulus/drifting_gratings).\n\nDrifting gratings are generally characterized by three parameters:\n\n1.  Orientation: This is the direction the bars are moving, and varies from 0-360 degrees. Orientation sensitivity is one of the most well studied features of neural coding for drifting gratings. In general, neurons respond preferentially to two orientations that are opposing, meaning they are 180 degrees apart, with the response fading out when you get more than 30 degrees away from the preferred orientation.\n2.  Spatial frequency: The width of the bars. The thicker the bars are, the lower the spatial frequency. The narrower the bars are, the higher the spatial frequency. Neurons tend to have a preferred spatial frequency.\n3.  Temporal frequency: How fast are the bars moving across the visual field. A higher frequency means the bars are drifting faster. Neurons tend to have a preferred temporal frequency.\n4.  Contrast: The degree to which the black and white lines of the grating deviate from gray. Neurons in V1 typically respond with increasing vigor as the contrast is raised from an all gray screen to solid black and white bars.\n\nWe will examine the responses of neurons in mouse primary visual cortex to these stimuli. The Allen Institute has a publicly available dataset of of such data. The data we will work with was collected while mice viewed a wide variety of stimuli, including many drifting gratings. According to their [white paper](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/circuits/visual-coding-neuropixels), the drifting gratings all had the same contrast (80%) and spatial frequency (0.04 cycles/degree), but varied in their orientation (0-315 in 45 degree increments), and temporal frequency (1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 Hz).\n\nI have compiled a small dataset of the spiking responses of neurons to these stimuli from a single mouse.\n\n::: {#18d077dc .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# load v1 response data\nv1_resp = pd.read_csv('./data/v1_dg_resp.csv')\nv1_resp.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=13}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>stimulus_presentation_id</th>\n      <th>start_time</th>\n      <th>stop_time</th>\n      <th>orientation</th>\n      <th>temporal_frequency</th>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <th>52</th>\n      <th>53</th>\n      <th>54</th>\n      <th>55</th>\n      <th>56</th>\n      <th>57</th>\n      <th>58</th>\n      <th>59</th>\n      <th>60</th>\n      <th>61</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>3815</td>\n      <td>1636.690362</td>\n      <td>1638.692042</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>18</td>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>81</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>28</td>\n      <td>27</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>3866</td>\n      <td>1789.818328</td>\n      <td>1791.819968</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>19</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>3884</td>\n      <td>1843.863438</td>\n      <td>1845.865118</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>13</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>51</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>42</td>\n      <td>19</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>3893</td>\n      <td>1870.886012</td>\n      <td>1872.887682</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>11</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>37</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>21</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>3924</td>\n      <td>1963.963798</td>\n      <td>1965.965448</td>\n      <td>0.0</td>\n      <td>1.0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>16</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>72</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>12</td>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>56</td>\n      <td>32</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>5 rows × 67 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe data has been imported as a pandas dataframe. Each row corresponds to the presentation of a drifting grating stimulus. The fields 'orientation' and 'temporal_frequency' describe properties of the drifting grating that was presented. Columns that are numbered correspond to different neurons that were recorded from. Each entry in a column contains the number of spikes that neuron fired during the 2 seconds that a stimulus was presented. You can see from the first 5 entries in the table that the same stimulus was presented multiple times. This allows us to get a sense of the variability in the neuron's response to the same stimulus. If we want to quickly inspect the mean response of each neuron to the different stimuli, we can use the `Dataframe`'s `pivot_table` method to calculate the mean response of each neuron to each type of stimulus.\n\n::: {#8310dcd3 .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nnrn_ids = [str(x) for x in range(62)] # neuron ids, 0-61\nv1_rfs = v1_resp.pivot_table(index=['orientation', 'temporal_frequency'], values=nrn_ids, aggfunc='mean')\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {#0f491288 .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# plot the receptive field of neuron 11\nexample_rf = v1_rfs['16'].values.reshape(8,5)\nori = np.unique(v1_rfs.index.get_level_values('orientation'))\ntf = np.unique(v1_rfs.index.get_level_values('temporal_frequency'))\n\n# 2D rf plotting function, we will use this a lot in subsequent analyses\ndef rf_plot(rf, title='Receptive Field', ax=None):\n    if ax is None:\n        fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    imh = ax.imshow(rf.T, origin='lower', aspect='auto')\n    ax.set_xlabel('Orientation (degrees)')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Temporal frequency (Hz)')\n    ax.set_xticks(np.arange(0,8))\n    ax.set_xticklabels(ori)\n    for tick in ax.get_xticklabels():\n        tick.set_rotation(90)\n    ax.set_yticks(np.arange(0,5))\n    ax.set_yticklabels(tf)\n    ax.set_title(title)\n    plt.colorbar(imh, ax=ax)\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(8,4))\naxs[0].plot(ori, np.mean(example_rf, axis=1))\naxs[0].set_title('Orientation tuning')\naxs[0].set_xlabel('Orientation (degrees)')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('Spike count (2 sec window)')\naxs[0].grid()\naxs[1].plot(tf, np.mean(example_rf,axis=0))\naxs[1].set_title('Temporal frequency tuning')\naxs[1].set_xlabel('Temporal frequency (Hz)')\naxs[1].grid()\nrf_plot(example_rf, ax=axs[2])\nfig.tight_layout()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-16-output-1.png){width=756 height=373}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe have plotted the response of the neuron in three different ways.

The second plot does the same but for temporal frequency. Lastly, the third plot illustrates the response as a two dimensional image with color being the spike count, orientation along the x-axis, and temporal frequency along the y-axis. For this example neuron we can see that it responds vigorously to stimuli with an orientation of 90 degrees, and that response increases with the temporal frequency of the drifting grating.\n\nThe neurons in this dataset exhibit a wide variety of responses.\n\n::: {#8114d84a .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# plot a grid of the receptive fields from all neurons\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(8,8)\naxs = axs.flatten()\nfor ind,id in enumerate(nrn_ids):\n    curr_rf = v1_rfs[id].values.reshape(8,5).T\n    axs[ind].imshow(curr_rf, origin='lower')\n    axs[ind].set_xticks([])\n    axs[ind].set_yticks([])\naxs[62].axis('off')\naxs[63].axis('off')\nfig.suptitle('Receptive fields of V1 neurons')\nfig.tight_layout()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-17-output-1.png){width=662 height=475}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nImagine we want to model the response of a single neuron to these stimuli. We can use a Poisson GLM to do this. We will use the `GLM` class from the `statsmodels` package to fit the model. Since the response of a neuron depends on both the orientation and temporal frequency of the drifting grating, along with their interaction, we will have to include all these terms in the model.\n\nThere is one extra complication here, though. Unlike the linear model we fit using the `OLS` class, we cannot just pass the dataframe and formula to the `GLM` function. Instead, we have to use another package to construct the design matrix `X` and the response vector `y`. We will use the `patsy` package to do this. The `dmatrices` function from the `patsy` package takes a formula and dataframe, then returns the design matrix and response vector. We can then pass these to the `GLM` function to fit the model.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Formula specification\n\n`patsy` allows you to specify formulae that can be translated into design matrices. There are many operators and features supported by them, but we will focus on just a few. For a detailed treatment of this, see [here](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formulas.html). Here `y` is the dependent variable and `x1` and `x2` are independent variables.\n\n| Operator | Description | Example |\n|----------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| `~` | Separates the dependent variable from the independent variables. | `y ~ x1 + x2` |\n| `+` | Adds a term to the model. | `y ~ x1 + x2` |\n| `*` | Includes the interaction between variables and their main effects. | `y ~ x1 * x2` |\n| `:` | Includes only the interaction between variables, without main effects. | `y ~ x1 : x2` |\n| `**` | Includes polynomial terms up to the specified degree. | `y ~ x1 + x2**2` |\n| `C()` | Indicates that a variable should be treated as a categorical variable. | `y ~ C(x1)` |\n:::\n\nAnother formatting detail is that the values in the 'orientation' and 'temporal_frequency' columns are stored as numeric data types. This means that if we construct a model it will treat these as continuous variables. This would result in the model trying to fit a single slope to the firing rate as a function of either orientation or temporal frequency. However, looking at our neurons, we can see that they respond to orientation and temporal frequency in a non-linear manner. Instead, we should treat these as categorical variables, with a separate $\\beta$ coefficients for each orientation and temporal frequency.

For instance, for drifting gratings at 90 degrees and 8 Hz our estimate is off by almost 25 spikes! We could examine the error for each stimulus to get a sense of how poorly the model performs, but it would be more convenient to have a measure that summarizes the error across all stimuli. For GLMs, the most common measure of error is the deviance. The deviance reflects how well the model fits the data by comparing the predicted response to the actual response. The lower the deviance, the better the model fits the data. The deviance is calculated as:\n\n$$ D = 2\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i\\log\\left(\\frac{y_i}{\\hat{y}_i}\\right) - y_i + \\hat{y}_i $$\n\nRecall from our linear regression lesson, $y_i$ is the actual response of the neuron, while $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted response. The deviance is calculated for each data point, and then summed across all data points. Looking at the equation, you can get some intuition for how it gives a lower value for a better fitting model. If $y_i$ and $\\hat{y}_i$ are the same, then the log term will be 0 and the sum of $y_i$ and $\\hat{y}_i$ will also be zero.

The deviance of the interaction model with train/test is higher than both the main effects and interaction models trained and tested on all the data. This is because training and testing on the entire dataset allows the model to fit to most of the variability, whether it is due to a systematic relationship or noise. Fitting the interaction model on just the training data and testing it on the test data caused a massive drop in performance (a higher deviance score). This is because the noise it fit to in the training set was not in the test set. Since the interaction terms seem especially noise sensitive, perhaps the model would perform better if we got rid of the interaction terms.

This suggests that the interaction model is capturing some of the underlying relationships in the data that are missed by only considering orientation and temporal frequency as independently contributing to the response of the neuron. However, we saw that the interaction model has a tendency to overfit, so it may be performing worse than is apparent. Is there a way to get the benefits of including all the interaction terms in the model while controlling for overfitting? Yes, if use *regularization* as part of the fitting process.\n\n## Regularization\n\nThe problem has been that we have so many factors accessible to the interaction model that it can now *overfit* the data. By overfitting, we mean that the model tries to capture all the variability in the training data. A good example of this phenomenon is fitting a curve with as many parameters as there are data points.\n\nImagine we have two variables, $x$ and $y$, that are related to each other by the equation $y=x+\\epsilon$. Here $\\epsilon$ is some noise that makes $x$ and $y$ only partially correlated. We want to predict the value of `y` given the value of `x`. There are a host of models that can be used. One is our old friend the line equation, where $y=b+wx$.\n\n::: {#4550141a .cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# create two partially correlated variables\nnp.random.seed(47)\nx = np.random.randn(10)\ny = x + np.random.randn(10)/2 # y is partially correlated with x\n\ndef plot_w_fit(x, y, mdl_order=1, ax=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to plot data and fit a linear model.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : array\n        Array of x values.\n    y : array\n        Array of y values.\n    mdl_order : int\n        Order of polynomial to fit to data.\n    ax : matplotlib.axes.Axes\n        Axis to plot on.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if ax is None:\n        ax = plt.gca()\n\n    min_x = np.min(x)-0.5\n    max_x = np.max(x)+0.5\n    x_samples = np.linspace(min_x,max_x,100)\n    # plot x vs y\n    ax.plot(x, y, 'k.', label='Train data')\n    y_lim = ax.get_ylim()\n    # plot polynomial fit\n    ax.plot(x_samples, np.poly1d(np.polyfit(x, y, mdl_order))(x_samples), 'r', alpha=0.5, label='Fit curve')\n    ax.set_xlabel('x')\n    ax.set_ylabel('y')\n    ax.set_ylim(y_lim)\n    ax.set_xlim([min_x, max_x])\n    ax.set_title('x vs y with order {} fit'.format(mdl_order))\n\nplot_w_fit(x,y)\nplt.legend()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-26-output-1.png){width=600 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA line captures the trend, larger values of $x$ lead to larger values of $y$, but almost none of the data points lie along the best fit line.

If we get to a model order of 9 (not plotted), the error drops to 0, which reflects the fact that the curve can now pass through each data point. On the other hand, the error on the test data decreases, then increases. It reaches its minimum at a model of order 1, which reflects the fact that the data was generated by a linear model, $y=x$. As the order increases past 1, the error increases, because the model is now making predictions between the training data points that are deviating from the underlying linear function that generates the data. This is the problem with overfitting, and why it is crucial to use separate training and test data sets to evaluate the performance of decoders.\n\nWith the polynomial fit, it is straightforward to set the model order to minimize error on the test data set. For our interaction model with 40 $\\beta$ coefficients, and that we do not *a priori* know which are important, this is not so easy. Regularization is a technique that can help us with this. Regularization works by adding a penalty term to the error function (which we will now call a loss function to fit with the terminology in machine learning) that the model is trying to minimize. This penalty term is a function of the model $\\beta$ coefficients, and it is designed to discourage the model from increasing their aggregate value. There are two common types of regularization, L1 and L2.\n\n### L2 and L1 penalties\n\nRegularization adds a term to the loss function that penalizes it for using non-zero $\\beta$ coefficients. This is referred to as the *penalty term*. The degree to which we allow this penalty term to influence the loss is set by the $\\lambda$ parameter. There are different functions, called *norms*, for measuring the magnitude of the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ vector. If we take the sum of the squared value for each $\\beta$, that is referred to as the L2 norm, or *ridge regression*. This is written as:\n\n$$ loss = loss_{fit} + \\lambda\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_i^2 $$\n\nThe consequence of this is that large $\\beta$s shrink to smaller values while still minimizing the $loss_{fit}$. The degree to which one emphasizes minimizing the $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is set by the $\\lambda$ parameter. If $\\lambda$ is set to 0, then the equation is the same loss function we have been using normally without regularization. As $\\lambda$ increases, the penalty becomes more stringent, pushing the individual $\\beta$ coefficients towards 0.\n\nHow does this affect the loss landscape? We can imagine it as being the summation of two surfaces, one for $loss_{fit}$ (which we were calling the error surface or landscape in the last lecture) and another for $\\lambda\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_i^2$. We can contrive a convex $loss_{fit}$, and then vary the strength of $\\lambda$, to see how it distorts it.\n\n::: {#6829dd5a .cell execution_count=29}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# create loss surface as quadratic function of two variables\nb0 = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)\nb1 = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)\nb00, b11 = np.meshgrid(b0, b1)\nloss_fit = (b00-8)**2 + (b11-2)**2\n\n# create L2 penalty surface\npp = b00**2 + b11**2\n\n# lambda list\nlambdas = [0, 0.5, 1, 10]\n\n# plot loss surface\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2,2)\nax = ax.flatten()\nfor ind, lam in enumerate(lambdas):\n    curr_loss = loss_fit + lam*pp\n    ax[ind].contourf(b00, b11, curr_loss, levels=10)\n    CS = ax[ind].contour(b00, b11, curr_loss, levels=10, colors='white')\n    ax[ind].plot(8, 2, 'ro', markersize=10)\n    ax[ind].clabel(CS, fontsize=10)\n    min_ind = np.argmin(curr_loss)\n    ax[ind].plot(b00.flatten()[min_ind], b11.flatten()[min_ind], 'wo', markersize=10)\n    ax[ind].set_title('$\\lambda$ = ' + str(lam))\n    ax[ind].grid()\n    ax[ind].set_aspect('equal')\nfig.suptitle('Loss surface for different $\\lambda$ values with L2 penalty')\nfig.tight_layout()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-30-output-1.png){width=538 height=474}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur contrived loss function has a minimum when `b0`=8 and `b1`=2. When the $\\lambda$ parameter is zero, the overall loss, $loss$ (white dot), is equal to $loss_{fit}$ (red dot). Increasing $\\lambda$ starts to shift the minimum of $loss$ towards the origin, where `b0` and `b1` are equal to 0. The $\\beta$ coefficient that is stronger is less affected by this, with `b1` approaching 0 sooner than `b0`. Note that this approach is gradual. Generally, the coefficients will not precisely reach 0. Thus, the L2 norm *shrinks* the weights.\n\nAnother norm is to take the sum of the absolute values of the $\\beta$ coefficients. This is known as the L1 norm, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). This is expressed mathematically as:\n\n$$ loss = loss_{fit} + \\lambda\\sum_{i=0}^{n}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_i| $$\n\nBecause we are not squaring the coefficients, the shape of the penalty is different. Instead of a smooth quadratic curve centered on zero, it will be an upside down pyramid centered on zero.\n\n::: {#d90efee6 .cell execution_count=30}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# create L2 penalty surface\npp = np.abs(b00) + np.abs(b11)\n\n# lambda list\nlambdas = [0, 1, 10, 100]\n\n# plot loss surface\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2,2)\nax = ax.flatten()\nfor ind, lam in enumerate(lambdas):\n    curr_loss = loss_fit + lam*pp\n    ax[ind].contourf(b00, b11, curr_loss, levels=10)\n    CS = ax[ind].contour(b00, b11, curr_loss, levels=10, colors='white')\n    ax[ind].plot(8, 2, 'ro', markersize=10)\n    ax[ind].clabel(CS, fontsize=10)\n    min_ind = np.argmin(curr_loss)\n    ax[ind].plot(b00.flatten()[min_ind], b11.flatten()[min_ind], 'wo', markersize=10)\n    ax[ind].set_title('$\\lambda$ = ' + str(lam))\n    ax[ind].grid()\n    ax[ind].set_aspect('equal')\nfig.suptitle('Loss surface for different $\\lambda$ values with L1 penalty')\nfig.tight_layout()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Regression2_files/figure-html/cell-31-output-1.png){width=538 height=474}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe $loss$ landscape is quite different now. As $\\lambda$ increases, the surface develops edges centered on the major axes of the graph. These drive each coefficient onto the corresponding axis where its value is clamped at zero. It does this first for the smallest coefficient, in this case `b1`. What this means is that the LASSO is not just shrinking the weights, but also *selecting* them, by forcing some to 0.\n\nThese are the two principal ways to penalize weights. Since they act on all the weights in a model, we do not have to preselect the features we want the model to train on. At this point you might be wondering, if we know that `b0` and `b1` are really contributing to the model, why would we want to shrink them? Aren't we just making the model worse by regularization? In this case, we know they matter, but the implicit assumption when using regularization with variables of unknown relevance is that most will not contribute and should be at or near zero. Moreover, as covered in the next section, the degree to which we penalize the coefficients will be set in a principled way that allows the data to tell us whether they are important or not. For that, we can fit the model multiple times to different values of $\\lambda$, and then check how the model performs on the test data set. The $\\lambda$ producing the lowest test error would be the one to use.\n\n### Regularization with statsmodels\n\nThe `GLM` class in the `statsmodels` package has a fit method that incorporates a regularization term. The `fit_regularized` method allows you to specify the type of regularization, L1 or L2, and the strength of the regularization, $\\lambda$. The lambda term is specified by the `alpha` input argument. Whether you want to use L1 or L2 regularization is specified by the `L1_wt` input argument. If `L1_wt` is set to 0, then L2 regularization is used. If it is set to 1, then L1 regularization is used. You can also set it to a value between 0 and 1 to use a combination of L1 and L2 regularization, which is known as *elastic net* regularization.\n\nFor the example here, we will go with L1 regularization, but feel free to experiment with L2 regularization as well. We will fit the model to a range of $\\lambda$ values, and then evaluate the model deviance on the test data set. The model with the lowest deviance on the test data set will be the one we use.\n\n::: {#1e4f2778 .cell execution_count=31}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# specify training model\ny_train, X_train = format_tables(v1_resp_train, '16', fm='spike_count ~ C(orientation) * C(temporal_frequency)')\nexp_mdl = sm.GLM(y_train, X_train, family=sm.families.Poisson())\n\n# test data\ny_test, X_test = format_tables(v1_resp_test, '16', fm='spike_count ~ C(orientation) * C(temporal_frequency)')\n\n# fit model with different lambdas\nparams = []\ndev_test = []\nlambdas = np.insert(np.geomspace(1e-5, 1e4, 20),0,0)\nfor alpha in lambdas:\n    exp_res = exp_mdl.fit_regularized(alpha=alpha, L1_wt=1)\n    params.append(exp_res.params)\n    dev_test.append(deviance(rf_test_true, exp_res.predict(X_test).reshape(8,5,3)[:,:,0]))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n/Users/drewheadley/anaconda3/envs/regress/lib/python3.10/site-packages/statsmodels/genmod/generalized_linear_model.py:1464: UserWarning: Elastic net fitting did not converge\n  warnings.warn(\"Elastic net fitting did not converge\")\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAbove we first format a training dataset of the response of our V1 neuron and pass it to a `GLM` object that will implement Poisson regression.

The intercept is the red line, main effects are green, interaction terms are blue, and the dotted black line is the $\\lambda$ with the best performance. Starting from the left side with the lowest $\\lambda$ value, we see that initially all $\\beta$ coefficients are non-zero. Turning up the $\\lambda$ knob, the coefficients start to collapse. First several of the interaction effects come shooting down to zero. Turning it further the main effects start to shrink. By the time we reach the $\\lambda$ with the best deviance on the test data set, most of the terms have either been zeroed or shrunk, with the exception of two terms that correspond to the orientation of 90 and 270 degrees (where the neuron responds most vigorously). Increasing $\\lambda$ further past this point, all the other coefficients latch on to zero. To compensate for their loss, the two remaining ones at the preferred orientations ramp up their values. However, further increases in lambda drive those down too. In response, the intercept started to increase to compensate for the loss of those terms. Ultimately, it too collapses to zero.\n\nThese changes explain the wobbles and cliff in the deviance score as $\\lambda$ increased. The initial decrease in deviance is probably due to the model being able to ignore the noise in the data. The subsequent waves in it reflect different strategies for capturing the neurons receptive field. Finally, the dramatic upswing in deviance at high $\\lambda$ is due to the model ignoring the data entirely.\n\n",
